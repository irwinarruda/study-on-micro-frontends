# Sudy on micro-frontends

This repository contains my study on webpack, especially using the module-federation plugin to create micro-frontends. With this project, I want to check 3 things:

- [x] Is it possible to add multiple web frameworks inside one application?
- [x] Is it possible to add one central state manager that persists within those frameworks?
- [x] Is it sustainable to break a big application into multiple parts so that deployment becomes easier?
